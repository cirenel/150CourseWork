You can rest now, 
the physical toil of the world
too pressured and observable 
By suicide and cancer and car wrecks and other more tragic intonations of Death,
you have found a path to some pause. 
Your soul, by means of remembrance, taken up new residence
for your mourners to uphold a bitwise shrine, 
scripted in California, 
	so the dramatization would be, 
//inadvertently sculpted in life by those they uphold in death.
hypertext taking the place of once mighty monolithic marble structures 
and cascading styles the works of artistic greats.
memorials to the dying have become cheap from their once lofty, immaculate heights. 
Scripted shrines erected by the hands of the one they memorialize
We choose what message is left to extoll
		without a designated next of kin, 
Our social media presence will forever be:
Memorable.
Marketable.
Profitable. 
Exploitable.  
Even in Death the hands of some “The Algorithm” 
greedily paw at our now unheld purses,
overbrimming with meta-data and mineables, 
predicting the newest nature of our needs.
Only time immemorial, 
or massive server farm failure, 
can now draw us down to absolute obscurity outside 
of the average anonymity our normal lives and shallow lies pursued.
Online, we never really die as we spin up new selves. 
	But Online we never really live with each adaptation a variation on the source. 
These cleansed, idealistic alters to our supposed selves
	Aspirational as much as unattainable
Giving supportive solace, 
	A public post for all to grieve at,
carrying on our memory with a programmatic efficiency 
Birthday reminders and reshared memories 
	your inadvertent clockwork legacy can run without you.
You can rest now.

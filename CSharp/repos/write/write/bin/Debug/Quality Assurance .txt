Quality Assurance 

the flaws in the Corelle
speak volumes to its age
from a time before quality control
became so rigorous
it was enough to be lead-free and functional
much less consistent in appearance
never mind the puckered twisting opaque clouds
suspended in ever-present motion
a factory oversight lending
much needed character to the 
now dated olive-green floral rim
they called you butterfly
once pumped out in vast quantities
for loyalty stamp participants
your grandmotherâ€™s cup
now listing as overpriced retro-chic 
targeting a far less sentimental crowd
found in the back of the communal cupboard
its reappearance triggering new life
to once forgotten memories
nearly lost to the savage, finite nature of the brain

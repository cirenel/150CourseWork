Holy War

Shot through with cowardice and fear,
flames and passions stoked
the warmth of undirectable anger so inviting 
so pure…
Giving in to that sweet and ever present rage
churning just below the surface of even the mildest countenance,
normal depth and nuance die in a fiery wake, 
any meager kindness plummeting in vain. 
I’d ask you to not so lightly heed the call of war –
the taste of human blood is most unpalatable
it will soon slice and spoil on your tongue with its tang –
though this promise of conflict as a path 
to some supposed salvation does tempt, 
what will your apocalypse desire as its fee?
Some data-cap locked, tiered monthly rate?
Your sanity and soul? 
Or just the light and love from your eyes? 
Abject destruction and actions of few
paid for by all…
profited upon by even fewer. 
Those calling back to past lessons learned
wretches and pain pulled forth from the past
are hailed as turncoats and spurned. 
I would ask you look me in the eye,
face to face,
before I die by the chrome-plated edge of your wielded weapon – so operatically dramatic.
I ask that you kill me yourself, 
	our lightless,loveless, hollow eyes locked,
away from these haphazard pre-formed chitterings…
these weak and regurgitated talking points from on high, 
in a meat-space too often forgotten 
against the pulsing throngs of the digital wastes.

ignora sum

keep chained the beast of ignorance lest it devour your sanity
tethering not your identity to your intellectual self 
for They will rip it away as jetsam
irrelevant–
inconvenient to Their cause–  
when flawed but pressing reason gives way to raw
untethered human hatred incarnate
I can no longer find the strength I once could
in the potential for better futures
I can’t when too soon ago true 
unempathetic faces crooned 
their necks broken and shattered to stare
And threw such slander to my unwavering question.

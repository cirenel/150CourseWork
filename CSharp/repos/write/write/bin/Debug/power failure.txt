power failure

plunged into darkness
half midday
silence from the printing burdens
no puzzing fluorescence 
the a/c whirs stopped
the clock will blink 12
we have to open windows
Though the heat will still linger
found to hear the wind
embrace us
wrapping leaves around
our dazzled faces
an unnerving deep silence blankets us
actual stillness 
too rare as to be unknown
